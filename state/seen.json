Its thermoelastic properties have not been determined since it cannot be quenched to the ambient conditions, although these properties are relevant to tracing carbonates in the Earth’s deep interior by seismological methods. In the prior synthetic experiments at 2.5 GPa and 1473 K [Hu et al. (2024) <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">J. Phys. Chem.

In this study, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in situ</span> single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on these samples from 100 to 500 K. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficients for the disordered samples fall within a narrow range of 5.8 ∼ 6.3 × 10<sup>-5</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, closely resembling those of aragonite and witherite, and systematically exceeding the ones in the ordered calcite-type structure. Ba<sup>2+</sup> exhibits minimal influence on the thermal expansivities in the disordered solid solutions, and the linearly extrapolated <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">α</span><sub><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">V</span></sub>(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">T</span>) for disordered CaCO<sub>3</sub> calcite is quite similar to that for aragonite. The anisotropy of axial thermal expansivity follow the trend: ordered calcite &gt; aragonite &gt; disordered calcite. The <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">M</span>O<sub>9</sub>-polyhedra (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">M</span> = Ca and Ba) in both aragonite and disordered calcite could mitigate the anisotropy of thermal expansion, and are more sensitive to temperature variation, as compared with the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">M</span>O<sub>6</sub>-octahedron in ordered calcite. The longer <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">M</span>-O bonds exhibit larger thermal expansivity than the shorter ones in the disordered samples. The Kumar <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">V</span>(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">T</span>) equation, established on Debye model, is adopted to extrapolate the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">α</span><sub><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">V</span></sub>(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">T</span>) models to higher temperatures, and the results for the disordered solid solutions still match well with aragonite and witherite at geologically relevant temperatures. Low-temperature measurements are necessary and important for comprehensive investigation on pressure-volume-temperature (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P-V-T</span>) equations of state (EOSs), as the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">α</span><sub><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">V</span></sub> coefficient increases rapidly below 300 K, and progressively at higher temperatures.

The new mineral is closely associated with tuite, and with other mineral inclusions in the host diamond (that are not in direct contact with grahampearsonite) including larnite, merrillite, apatite, diopside, ilmenite, magnetite, calcite and an unidentified phosphate phase.

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) and volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits represent two major classes of metallic ore systems. They commonly form in comparable geologic settings and may exhibit overlapping metallogenic signatures. Trace element compositions of pyrite and chalcopyrite can provide critical constraints for distinguishing their genetic origins. Here we compile a global geochemical dataset of pyrite and chalcopyrite and evaluate multiple machine learning (ML) classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Stacking models. Classification accuracies reach 0.96 (RF), 0.96 (XGBoost), 0.95 (MLP), and 0.99 (Stacking) for chalcopyrite, and 0.96 (RF), 0.98 (XGBoost), 0.96 (MLP), and 0.98 (Stacking) for pyrite. Key discriminative trace elements include Ni, Pb, and Se in chalcopyrite, and Ni, Se, Pb, and Sb in pyrite, reflecting distinct enrichment mechanisms in SEDEX and VMS systems. To validate model performance, we conducted LA-ICP-MS and XRF analyses of chalcopyrite and pyrite from the Dongshengmiao Zn-Pb-Cu deposit (Inner Mongolia, China). The trained ML classifiers consistently classify fine-grained pyrite and chalcopyrite from Dongshengmiao as VMS-related. Integrated with previous petrological, geochemical, and isotopic evidence, these results suggest that submarine volcanic activity played a dominant role in ore formation. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of ML-based mineral chemistry discrimination and provide new insights into the genesis of the Dongshengmiao deposit.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Recent roadworks across the 40-km-wide Araguainha impact structure (AIS) provided new, extensive exposures for mapping and structural analysis. We present an updated geological map of the AIS, highlighting Passa Dois Group Blocks (PDGBs) and the central uplift geology. Mapping indicates that faults outside the AIS likely result from pre-impact regional tectonics. The most prominent structural features in the AIS are primarily linked to the excavation and modification stages of cratering, with strain likely accommodated through detachments along interfaces between lithologic units with different rheologies. The outer rim and intermediate sections of the structure exhibit similar structural frameworks, where large, fault-bounded blocks dominate. PDGBs generally have quasi-centripetal structural vergences. In the outer rim region, PDGBs resemble gravity-driven complex slumps. There is no consistent evidence for the previously referred kilometer-scale concentric rings in the outer parts of the AIS, which had been surmised as evidence for a peak-ring configuration. PDGBs occur only between 10 km and 20 km from the structure’s center as a result of concurrent central uplift formation and crater rim collapse. The central uplift diameter is estimated at up to 20 km, and there is evidence for its asymmetric collapse. Besides rare injections of impact melt rock, the northern core comprises three types of impact breccia (suevite and polymict lithic breccia). The core can be divided into a structurally diverse megablock zone that overlies a seemingly coherent but folded and faulted crater floor of (meta)sedimentary basement. The AIS exhibits structural asymmetry that may be controlled, in part, by pre-impact anisotropy of the target.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Orogenic gold vein deposits are an economically important, well-documented mineralization class with limited consensus regarding the role of juvenile magmatism in their genesis. Here we use He isotopes to determine the contribution of mantle heat in driving the ore fluids responsible for major gold deposits in the Laurentian Caledonides of Britain and Ireland, including all active mines (Cononish, Curraghinalt, and Cavanacaw), many of which are tentatively classed as orogenic. The <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He of fluids in Au-bearing sulfides (0.09−3.3 R<sub>a</sub>) require a significant contribution from exsolved magmatic volatiles, implying that mantle heat is intrinsic to ore formation. The largest deposit, Curraghinalt, formed from the hottest ore fluids with the highest proportion of magmatic He during the Grampian Event. The smaller late-Caledonian deposits precipitated from cooler fluids with lower <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He. Ore-fluid <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He does not correlate with sulfide δ<sup>34</sup>S (−1.9−9.1‰) reflecting multiple crustal S sources. A positive correlation between the maximum <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He and Au reserve implies that gold was sourced from mafic mantle melts generated by post-subduction processes during the Caledonian orogeny.</span>",

Thus, identifying and dating impact structures, especially in ancient rocks, can provide crucial temporal context for understanding the role of impacts in Earth’s evolution. We present novel characterization of muscovite from shocked pegmatites of the Yarrabubba structure in Western Australia. Shocked muscovite developed kink bands that underwent chemical modification, increasing the celadonite content, interpreted to be coeval with the impact event. In situ Rb−Sr (2463 ± 25 Ma) and <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar dates (ca. 2464 Ma; probability peak) from low-strain, chemically unmodified muscovite overlap with zircon U−Pb dates (2440 ± 16 Ma) of pegmatite crystallization.

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Wrinkle structures are often interpreted to be formed by photosynthetic microbial mats. They are rare in Phanerozoic marine subtidal environments because animal activity typically destroys mats or biofilms before lithification. We report wrinkle structures in lower Toarcian (Lower Jurassic) turbidites from the Tagoudite Formation in Morocco. These wrinkles are consistent with those from shallower deposits; however, given their paleodepth (∼200 m), it is unlikely they were formed by photoautotrophic communities. Modern turbidites are known to host chemosynthetic communities, often with extensive microbial mat formation. We propose the Tagoudite Formation wrinkles were formed by chemosynthetic communities, and the sedimentological, geochemical, and hydrographical conditions of the turbidites excluded grazers, allowing wrinkle structure lithification. Wrinkle structures occur in Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian, and Jurassic turbidites, and we posit that chemosynthetic mats growing on turbidity deposits represent a previously dismissed, underappreciated, or unrecognized mode of preservation. The chemosynthetic mat−induced wrinkle paradigm has significant implications; this taphonomic window for wrinkle preservation in turbidites expands the range of environments where these microbially induced sedimentary structures form and the communities that made them. Wrinkles in turbidites also represent new possibilities for the study of chemosynthetic ecosystems in deep time.</span>",

The occurrence of a vitrified dendritic pigeonite with similar composition suggests that kuratite formed during the impact induced melting-cooling processes.

Mantle xenoliths are one of the primary sources to estimate the water budget of the Earth’s upper mantle. Here we present a comprehensive study of orthopyroxene from mantle-derived xenoliths across a ∼300 km long transect in the back-arc region of Southern Patagonia. Spinel harzburgites, lherzolites and olivine websterites were collected, these record equilibration temperatures ranging from 850 to 1100 °C, all within the spinel peridotite stability field. Orthopyroxene was studied using polarized and unpolarized Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Major and trace element (including hydrogen) chemistry of olivine, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene indicate that the hydrogen content is neither correlated to primary composition of mantle minerals nor to a metasomatic overprint recorded by incompatible trace elements in pyroxenes. Variability in the water contents in olivine, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene and H-loss profiles in olivine and orthopyroxene are provide evidence of modification of the original mantle water contents, re-equilibration with the host-magma and H-loss upon ascent and/or eruption. Orthopyroxene spectra are subdivided based on the relative ratio of the peak height of the 3590 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 3570 cm<sup>-1</sup> peaks (PH<sub>3590</sub>/PH<sub>3570</sub>): group 1 has PH<sub>3590</sub>/PH<sub>3570</sub> &gt; 1 and group 2 has PH<sub>3590</sub>/PH<sub>3570</sub> &lt; 1. The 3570 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 3590 cm<sup>-1</sup> peaks are present in the majority of orthopyroxene FTIR spectra. Fast cooling rates during eruption are associated with PH<sub>3590</sub>/PH<sub>3570</sub> &gt; 1 and slow cooling rates are associated to PH<sub>3590</sub>/PH<sub>3570</sub> &lt; 1. The peak shift from 3590 cm<sup>-1</sup> to 3570 cm<sup>-1</sup> observed in single crystals is dependent on temperature and cooling rates, inter-site reactions and is related to H-loss. H-profiles from mantle orthopyroxene suggest that they experienced eruption – cooling timescales of just a few minutes to hours showing the potential of using frozen H-profiles in orthopyroxene to extract timescales and infer cooling mechanism at the surface.</span>",

However, the deformation mechanisms of intergranular coesite and its retrograde quartz are not well understood. This study investigated the defect structures of shear-deformed coesite and quartz using Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to elucidate their deformation behavior under varying high differential stresses, specifically in the range of 903 to 1607 MPa. The results indicate that EBSD is ineffective for analyzing defects in materials experiencing substantial plastic deformation. In contrast, TEM analysis visually demonstrates that dislocation density and the prevalence of dislocation tangles increase with rising differential stress in both coesite and quartz. For coesite, hot-pressed samples predominantly exhibited free dislocations and subgrain boundaries, whereas shear-deformed samples displayed dislocation tangles, indicative of enhanced dislocation production. Quartz samples similarly transitioned from free dislocations to dislocation tangles under higher differential stress. Empirical power function relationships between dislocation density (ρ) and differential stress (σ) were established: σ = 3.65 × 10<sup>−23</sup> ρ<sup>2.39</sup> for coesite and σ = 2.51 × 10<sup>−4</sup> ρ<sup>0.64</sup> for quartz. These findings elucidate the deformation mechanisms of coesite and quartz under high differential stress, suggesting that the experimental samples may closely reflect the natural deformation processes of intergranular coesite and its retrograde quartz. This study advances the understanding of the role of coesite and quartz in recording tectonic stresses and establishes a TEM-based methodology for estimating differential stress in UHP rocks.</span>",

Despite the significance, the detailed mechanisms of HROM transforming into crystalline graphite under high-pressure remain poorly understood. This study addresses this gap by conducting high-temperature and high-pressure (HTHP) experiments on liptinite, a type of HROM extracted from coal. We subjected liptinite to pressures ranging from 500MPa to 3GPa and temperatures up to 1073K to simulate geological conditions. Using techniques such as optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, we characterized the structural and valence state changes of liptinite. Key findings include the transformation of liptinite into a three-dimensional graphene foam and nanocrystalline graphite at pressures above 1.5GPa. We observed an increase in sp<sup>2</sup> carbon content and a decrease in sp<sup>3</sup> carbon, indicating a reduction in defects and an enhancement in aromatic carbon networks. The study also revealed that HROM contributes significantly to the horizontal growth but less to the vertical stacking of carbon layers during graphitization, which has implications for the differential graphitization processes of sedimentary organic matter. This research provides unique insights into the graphitization process of HROM and its implications for the geological stability and preservation of organic carbon in the lithosphere. The findings contribute significantly to the understanding of carbon evolution and the formation of graphite deposits.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Transform faults are one of the three main types of plate boundaries recognized in plate tectonics theory. However, various interpretations of their original definition have led to confusion in the literature. This paper presents a comprehensive review of this issue and introduces new concepts, including the transform fault system and continental margin−type transform faults. A transform fault system consists of geometrically or kinematically linked tectonic units along a transform fault. By integrating this concept with microplate tectonics, the evolution and mechanisms of 20 typical transform fault systems are analyzed in detail. From a kinematic perspective, most transform faults are passively controlled at their terminations by tectonic features, such as mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones, collisional zones, and rift zones. They serve as key features for distinguishing between the regimes of plate tectonics and mobile lids. A tectonic system without transform faults cannot be qualified as a plate tectonic regime, as both globally networked subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges can also exist within a mobile lid tectonic regime. However, the global linkage of all tectonic boundaries is impossible in both regimes due to strain localization and fault adjustments. Finally, we redefine transform faults as nearly vertical accommodation faults whose displacement abruptly terminates at one or both ends between plates. This redefinition emphasizes how variations in displacement continuity, motion changes, and kinematic adjustments regulate shear, accretion, or subduction between interacting plates.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">In this study, the factors that drive the Yigong earthquake swarm in the southeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau are investigated. By analyzing the temporal and spatial characteristics of the earthquake swarm, the Xixingla fault is identified as the primary agent in driving the genesis of the earthquake swarm and the seasonal variations in seismic activity. As a significant branch of the southeastern Jiali fault, the Xixingla fault is subjected to high stress stemming from the northward compressive forces of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. Additionally, climate variations amplify freeze-thaw cycles in glaciers and increase riverine erosion, leading to increased topographical steepness and greater fracturing of rock masses. During the monsoon season, elevated temperatures and heavy precipitation result in substantial glacial melt, causing rapid accumulation of meltwater and rainfall in Yigong Lake. This phenomenon increases the surface load acting on the fault zone, whereas infiltrating water increases pore pressure along rock fractures and faults. The stress accumulated along the fault ultimately triggers rupture, resulting in the formation of an earthquake swarm. Furthermore, the increased stress on the fault due to the 2017 Milin earthquake contributed to a higher frequency of seismic events in the Yigong region. Understanding the hydrogeological and tectonic conditions in Yigong and its vicinity is essential for predicting future seismic activity and developing effective disaster prevention strategies.</span>",

While the basic geological information about the North Himalayan gneiss domes has been established, there have been multiple different mechanisms put forth to explain their development. This study investigates the Lalong dome in southern Tibet using detailed field observations, structural kinematics, petrology, phase equilibrium modeling, and new monazite, titanite, and detrital zircon U-Th-Pb geochronology. These data are used to construct pressure-temperature-time-deformation (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P-T-t-D</span>) paths, which confirm the overprinting of ca. 27−26 Ma Barrovian-type metamorphism (565−620 °C, 7.4−8.5 kbar, ∼23 °C/km) by younger 23−20 Ma Buchan-type metamorphism (530−660 °C, 3.5−5.5 kbar, ∼40 °C/km). The Buchan-type metamorphism is directly related to granite emplacement in the dome core, which is also associated with contemporaneous skarnization (590−700 °C) and enrichment of Li, Be, and Sn. Biotite in situ Rb-Sr dates of ca. 13 Ma are interpreted to reflect cooling within the dome. Detrital zircon dates and metamorphic conditions are consistent with Tethyan Himalayan sequence (THS) affinity for mantle schists and skarns within the Lalong area. Finally, a top-to-the-north extensional structure, interpreted to be equivalent to the upper South Tibetan detachment system (upper STDS), was identified within the THS rocks in the Lalong dome. The data and observations collected as part of this study are interpreted to reflect a magmatic diapirism origin for the Lalong dome with horizontal stretching and vertical thinning facilitated by the upper STDS. In the Early Miocene Himalaya, shallower extensional structures were active simultaneously with crustal shortening at depth and crosscut the stratigraphic boundary into the THS, providing chances for high-silica magma emplacement into much shallower levels.</span>",

However, its application in diabetic wound management remains constrained by suboptimal therapeutic efficacy, recurrent infections, treatment-associated pain, scar formation, and dependence on costly specialized equipment. Here, we present a sunlight-activated nanospray formulation comprising chitosan oligosaccharide-coated nanoparticles (SPS), engineered for the rapid and effective management of diabetic wounds in outdoor and resource-limited settings. SPS enables efficient ROS generation under ambient natural light, thereby reducing treatment-associated discomfort while maintaining effective photodynamic antimicrobial action. Additionally, the chitosan oligosaccharide coating confers intrinsic hemostatic, antibacterial, and antioxidative properties that synergistically accelerate wound closure and reduce the risk of scarring. The topical spray delivery circumvents systemic phototoxicity, improving patient compliance and broadening the accessibility of PDT. This strategy effectively overcomes the inherent limitations of conventional PDT by leveraging ambient light for activation and providing a cost-effective, non-invasive, and patient-friendly platform for diabetic wound care, thereby expanding the clinical utility of photodynamic interventions for managing chronic and complex wounds.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>This work proposes a unified neuromorphic spike-based LLMs (NSLLM) framework to simultaneously address the challenges of high energy consumption and low interpretability in large language models (LLMs). Our framework transforms LLMs into efficient NSLLMs by converting their behaviors into neural dynamics–such as spike trains–through rigorous mathematical modeling and complemented by advanced techniques including quantization and sparsification. This transformation also enables the analysis of information encoding processes using computational neuroscience tools, thereby offering a novel neuroscientific perspective that conceptualizes LLMs as neural populations to enhance their interpretability. Leveraging a hardware-algorithm co-design paradigm, NSLLM can completely eliminate matrix multiplication (MatMul) while maintaining high performance. We designed a custom MatMul-free hardware core on the VCK190 FPGA to validate the <strong>1.5</strong>-billion-parameter NSLLM model, achieving a dynamic power consumption of only <strong>13.849</strong> watts and an inference throughput of <strong>161.8</strong> tokens per second. Compared with the A800 GPU, this implementation improves energy efficiency, memory usage, and inference throughput by <strong>19.8×</strong>, <strong>21.3×</strong>, and <strong>2.2×</strong>, respectively. This work provides a novel perspective within a unified framework to enhance both the energy efficiency and interpretability of LLMs, offering valuable insights for future neuromorphic chip designs tailored for large models.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for constructing ‘second window’ near-infrared (1000–1700 nm) light-emitting diodes (NIR-II LEDs), but their practical application has been hampered by low film external quantum efficiency (EQE). Here, we report a chemical strategy that incorporates photoactive fluorophores—spanning fluorescence, phosphorescence, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)—into CQD films to boost NIR-II emission. Energy transfer from fluorophores (via both singlet and triplet pathways) raises the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of CQD to 85% beyond 1000 nm. As a result, these composite films power NIR-II LEDs with a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.3% for emission over 1000 nm, the highest among all LEDs with emission &gt; 1000 nm. We further demonstrate the approach’s scalability by fabricating large-area (30 mm × 30 mm) NIR-II LEDs with uniform high performance.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Congenital heart defects (CHD) is among the most common human congenital malformations (about 0.8% of newborns), but the etiology of approximately 85% of CHD cases remains unknown. Our study identified fluorene-9-bisphenol (BHPF), a widely used plastic additive, which was detected with rates of 100% in maternal blood, 84.9% in amniotic fluid, and 46.7% in umbilical cord blood. BHPF levels across all three sample types were significantly higher in CHD patients compared to control groups. Furthermore, frequent consumption of plastic-bottled beverages during pregnancy was correlated with elevated BHPF levels and was more prevalent among CHD (28.6%) than control group (4.8%). Encouragingly, we identified the clinically approved tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) analog, sapropterin (SD), as a potential therapeutic intervention of BHPF-mediated CHD in preclinical examinations. We advocate for prioritizing restrictions on BHPF, especially in products intended for mothers and infants, and recommend minimizing the consumption of plastic-bottled beverages to reduce BHPF exposure.</span>",

Here, the authors revealed that PKA activation drives ABCC4 to the plasma membrane and organizes a PDZ-dependent protein network with actin cytoskeleton and scaffolds, like SCRIB, that stabilize the transporter and optimize cAMP efflux. Furthermore, the authors show that the potent ABCC4 inhibitor Ceefourin 2 disrupts this network, revealing a non-canonical mechanism of ABCC4 inhibition.",

The mechanical processes that couple crystals, bubbles, and melt are nonlinear, and their expression in magmatic systems can vary greatly with the relative phase proportions in the magma. In this review we propose a multiscale perspective on multiphase magmas under crustal storage conditions, with a specific focus on phase separation mechanisms. We start with an inventory of forces acting on a single crystal or volatile bubble in a silicate melt. We follow with a discussion of different upscaling strategies to simplify the description of the dynamics at greater scales, relevant to the evolution of magma reservoirs.We discuss recent progress in the development of models to study the internal dynamics of magma reservoirs, highlight current challenges, and propose possible paths for further progress.</p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The mechanical interaction between the constituents (melt, crystals, and bubbles) at the scale of crystals controls the properties of magmas.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The choice of upscaling strategy is controlled by the processes that are considered.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Melt-crystal separation processes and their efficiency vary with the relative proportion of the phases involved.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Melt extraction by repacking is fast compared to compaction but stalls as the mush reaches the maximum packing.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

    "summary": "<div><p>The burgeoning field of phylogenetic paleoecology combines paleoecological data with hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships to tease apart the roles that ecology and relatedness both play in the evolution and function of an organism. The purpose of this review is to make phylogenetic paleontology more accessible to a wider array of scientists and attract new researchers to the discipline. Herein, we use recently published analyses of a diverse array of fossil animals (e.g., arthropods, echinoderms, and carnivorans) to better illustrate the breadth of research questions that can be studied using phylogenetic paleoecology. Phylogenetic paleoecology has been used to discern drivers of morphological change and variations in evolutionary rates, along with the relationship between phylogeny, biogeography, and ecology. Additional avenues of research could focus on modularity and mosaicism in evolution, as well as the impact of mass extinctions and adaptive radiations. By encouraging a greater diversity of scientific backgrounds and plurality of thought, and by incorporating new perspectives from different areas of both geology and biology, the field of phylogenetic paleoecology will lead to the consideration of new questions, avenues, and possibilities that would otherwise go unexplored.</p></div>",

This review focuses on the potential effects of this negative vote on the humanities and social sciences by drawing on perspectives from science and society. It argues that stratigraphers&#8217; negative vote is likely to have little effect on other disciplines because most humanists and social scientists are not using the stratigraphic term. Instead, they understand the Anthropocene as shorthand for human-caused environmental change, which is clearly occurring. Humanists and social scientists also remain interested in the Anthropocene because the collapsing distinction between the human and the geological continues to present challenges worth engaging with. While the diverse interpretations and engagements with the Anthropocene may result in incoherence, this review summarizes literature that suggests that this plurality of meanings is what gives the Anthropocene concept its strength.The Anthropocene is likely to remain a key concept in the humanities and social sciences, despite stratigraphers&#8217; rejection of the epoch.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The Anthropocene means different things to different disciplines.

    "summary": "<div><p>Understanding the links between magmatic evolution and volcanic eruptions requires knowledge of the physical behavior of magmas stored and transported within Earth's crust. The mobility of magmas is fundamentally tied to their rheology and therefore the temperatures they experience during residence&#8212;their thermal history. We review petrological and other constraints on magma thermal histories that silicic magmas experience during crustal storage. We also focus on the recent debate between cold and warm magma storage models, using a common conceptual framework that allows a more coherent synthesis of magma storage conditions. Evidence suggests that although most silicic crustal magmatic systems spend most of their time in a rheologically immobile state, variations exist in space and time.

I have also worked across several discipline boundaries, an activity I call scientific trespassing. My career has unfolded in such unexpected ways that, like anyone's life and like the history of our planet, it can only be seen as a most improbable journey. A focus on these three concepts and on the history of geology (a traditional name used here for all the Earth sciences) leads to the understanding that geology was once the crown jewel of sciences, and that after a century of necessary but routine geologic mapping, geology now needs to resume its crown jewel role because the understanding and care of our planet is becoming humanity's most urgent task.</p></div>",

While thermodynamic data are available for many endmembers, there are significant gaps in both thermodynamic and associated structural constraints, especially for complex systems. The continuous evolution of high temperature calorimetry into oxidative drop solution calorimetry has facilitated the measurement of enthalpies of formation and mixing and surface energies involving nonoxides, including chalcogenides.

The kinetics of localized physical and chemical transitions brought about by the shock wave are responsive to this time history. Solid-state viscosity of the media is responsible for establishing the time history of a shock wave. In 2003, researcher H.

This review furthers Melosh's epic efforts. In pursuing both the nuclear ground shock data and supporting laboratory test data, it undertakes methods for determining and calculations of the viscosity of solid materials on the respective scales. Further, applicability of viscoelasticity in modeling the shock response on the scales of concern is demonstrated and applied. The review closes with a discussion of universal features of the shock wave viscous time history in solid materials. Solid viscosity as an adiabatic invariant is presented, and commonalties of the solid shock wave with the nonlinear dynamics of ocean waves are noted.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>This article reviews Melosh's analysis of nuclear ground shock measurements with application to shock wave structuring viscosity.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>It discusses viscoelastic calculations with application to wave structure of nuclear ground shocks and laboratory shock waves in brittle granular solids, and universal features of the viscous shock wave structure and invariance of the dissipative action are considered.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>It also discusses wave action invariance in both the nonlinear dynamics of ocean waves and the steady wave structure of shock waves in solid matter.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

Paleontological studies provide a foundation of description and taxonomy to support deeper forays into ecology and evolution considering geographic, morphologic, and functional changes through time with nonanalog species and climate states. Although chondrichthyan teeth are most studied, analyses of dermal denticle metrics and soft tissue imprints are increasing. Recent methodological advances in morphology and geochemistry are elucidating fine-scale details, whereas large datasets and ecological modeling are broadening taxonomic, temporal, and geographic perspectives. The combination of ecological metrics and modeling with environmental reconstruction and climate simulations is opening new horizons to explore form and function, demographic dynamics, and food web structure in ancient marine ecosystems. Ultimately, the traits and taxa that endured or perished during the many catastrophic upheaval events in Earth's history contribute to conservation paleobiology, which is a much-needed perspective for extant chondrichthyans.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The longevity and abundance of the chondrichthyan fossil record elucidates facets of ecological, evolutionary, and environmental histories.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Though lacking postcranial, mineralized skeletons, dental enameloid and dermal denticles exquisitely preserve morphology and geochemistry.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Technical advances in imaging, geochemistry, and modeling clarify the linkages between form and function with respect to physiology, diet, and environment.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Conservation efforts can benefit from the temporal and spatial perspective of chondrichthyan persistence through past global change events.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

Methane is formed by diverse abiotic pathways across a range of pressures and temperatures. Biological methanogenesis for anaerobic respiration uses a terminal nickel-containing enzyme and is limited to the archaeal domain of life. Methane can also be produced in aerobic microbes during bacterial methylphosphonate and methylamine degradation and via nonenzymatic reactions during oxidative stress. Abiotic CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> is produced via thermogenic reactions and during serpentinization reactions in the presence of metal catalysts. Reconstructions of CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> cycling over geologic time are largely inferential. Throughout Earth's history, CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> has probably been the second most important climate-forcing greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide.

    "summary": "<div><p>Intrinsic magnetic fields were once commonplace across our Solar System, and many planetary bodies have sustained active dynamos to the present day. The nature and behavior of these dynamos vary widely, however, reflecting the diverse internal conditions of planets as summarized in this review. For the terrestrial planets, the existence of active dynamos and/or ancient remanent magnetization recorded in crustal rocks, or lack thereof, lead to questions about their timing and power sources. Paleomagnetic studies reveal that many small bodies in the Solar System exhibit remanent magnetization, often attributed to ancient core dynamos with little known about the fluid dynamics. For the gas giants, their dipole-dominated magnetic fields and internal structures are relatively well-characterized, with dilute cores that are not centrally concentrated and other stable layers that likely affect the dynamo in ways that are not yet understood. For the ice giants, their multipolar magnetic fields and internal structures are unusual yet poorly constrained, to the extent that even the water-to-rock ratio is not well-known. Through adoption of a broader comparative planetology approach, the study of dynamos in exoplanets and cool stars enriches our understanding of dynamo theories.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Planetary dynamos exhibit diverse magnetic fields shaped by their distinct physical and chemical conditions.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The study of planets and stars connects planetary science, geophysics, and astrophysics, revealing shared dynamo processes.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>While significant progress has been made in understanding planetary and stellar magnetic fields, many puzzles still persist.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

The magnetic properties of rocks and sediments are assumed to be stable and largely attributable to inorganic processes. This conventional view overlooks mounting evidence of microorganisms as key players in rock transformations and geological processes. Iron-bearing minerals are ubiquitous in most environments and are commonly used by microorganisms as electron donors and acceptors. Microorganisms modulate rock magnetic properties by creating, altering, and dissolving Fe-bearing minerals, potentially modifying the original magnetization, complicating interpretations of the magnetic record. This review provides an overview of biogenic pathways that modulate magnetic minerals and discusses common, yet underutilized, magnetic methods for capturing such behavior. Appreciating the influence of microbial activities on magnetic properties will improve our interpretations of Earth's geologic past and its elemental cycling.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Microorganisms modulate rock magnetic properties, challenging traditional views of a geologically stable magnetic record formed solely by inorganic processes.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Microbial iron cycling modulates magnetic properties modifying magnetic information recorded in rocks.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Microbial processes may have impacted Earth's magnetic history more deeply than previously understood.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Recognizing microbial contributions is critical for accurate interpretation of paleomagnetic and environmental magnetic records and could aid in the search for life on other planetary bodies.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

This article describes this hierarchy of climate sensitivities and associated modeling approaches.

    "summary": "<div><p>The emergence of continental crust above sea level influences Earth's surface environments and climate patterns, and it creates diverse habitats that promote biodiversity. Earth exhibits bimodal hypsometry with elevated continents and a submerged seafloor. However, it remains elusive when and how this unique feature was first established. The geological record suggests the presence of subaerial landmasses between ca.&#160;3.8 and 2.4&#160;billion years ago (Ga), but their spatial extent and longevity remain unclear. Further, the tectonic processes governing the proportion of continental land to ocean basins and topography during this period are poorly understood. Here, we synthesize a variety of geological and geochemical proxies to suggest that crustal emergence did occur in the early-to-mid Archean, primarily exposing precratonized volcanic crust for brief time periods. Stable continental crust on a regional scale (as cratons) began emerging around ca.&#160;3.2&#8211;3.0 Ga, facilitated by the development of thick, stable cratonic lithospheres. Over hundreds of millions of years, voluminous magmatism within a plateau-type setting led to the formation of thick, felsic crust and depleted mantle keels, allowing cratons to rise above sea level via isostatic adjustment. The areal extent of emergent land increased from ca.&#160;3.0 to 2.5&#160;Ga owing to the formation of more cratons, likely coinciding with the onset of plate tectonics, and culminated around ca.&#160;2.5&#8211;2.2&#160;Ga when land surface area and freeboard conditions resembled those observed today. These newly emerged landmasses possibly played a critical role in oxygenating the atmosphere and oceans, cooling the climate, and promoting biodiversity during the late Archean to early Paleoproterozoic.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Continental emergence marks a pivotal moment in Earth's history, impacting the planet's atmosphere, oceans, climate, and life evolution.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>We review the rock record to infer the timing, nature, and tectonic drivers of continental emergence on early Earth.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Emergence on early Archean Earth was mostly transient, exposing primarily volcanic crust.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The first stable continental land formed at ca. 3.2&#8211;3.0 Ga due to the development of thick cratons and their isostatic adjustment.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Emergent land area increased from ca. 3.0 to 2.5 Ga as more felsic crust formed and plate tectonics began.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",
