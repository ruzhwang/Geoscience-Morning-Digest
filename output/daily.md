- **A speleothem record from the Fertile Crescent covering the last deglaciation better contextualizes neolithization**  
  🔗 https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2502092122?af=R
  📝 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 50, December 2025. <br />SignificanceA speleothem record from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq records climatic and environmental changes during the transition from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the Holocene. It shows that local precipitation changes were synchronous with ...

- **Large role of anthropogenic climate change in driving smoke concentrations across the western United States from 1992 to 2020**  
  🔗 https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2421903122?af=R
  📝 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. <br />SignificanceWildfire activity has increased dramatically in the western United States over the last three decades, leading to a significant impact on air quality and human health. This study highlights the substantial role of anthropogenic climate change (...

- **Warming from cold pools: A pathway for mesoscale organization to alter Earth’s radiation budget**  
  🔗 https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2513699122?af=R
  📝 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. <br />SignificanceShallow cumulus clouds play a central role in Earth’s energy balance, but remain a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. While climate models often assume these clouds are fully controlled by large-scale factors, observations ...

- **An Archean atmosphere rich in sulfur biomolecules**  
  🔗 https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2516779122?af=R
  📝 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. <br />SignificanceSulfur biomolecules, such as the amino acids cysteine and methionine, are ubiquitous in all modern organisms. However, few prebiotic chemistry studies have demonstrated the abiotic production of organosulfur biomolecules. This fact coupled ...

- **Volcanic forcing of the Lomagundi–Jatuli carbon isotope excursion**  
  🔗 https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2519431122?af=R
  📝 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 49, December 2025. <br />SignificanceThe Lomagundi–Jatuli Event (LJE), more than 2 billion years ago, marks a major shift in Earth’s carbon cycle, following the rise of atmospheric oxygen. Its cause, however, remains unresolved. We dated black shales from Gabon to 2.194 billion ...
